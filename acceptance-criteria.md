- the user chooses to play the game
- the game starts with the user having 3 lives and a score of 0. Categories are created.
- the intro is displayed
- while the user still has more than one life and hasn't finished the game (can still choose from categories):
  - the player is asked to choose a category. If the choice is not recognised, the user is prompted to choose again from given category options.
  - when the player chooses a valid category, that category is deleted from the dictionary and the user plays their chosen category
- the user plays their chosen category:
  - a word is randomly selected by the computer from the chosen category and jumbles its letters
  - the word is removed from the category
  - the computer prints: What {word} is this? and prints the jumbled word
  - when the word is guessed correctly, the lives remain the same and the computer prints "Right!"
  - when the word is guessed incorrectly, users lose a life and the computer tells them they are wrong and offers a clue
  -   if the user accepts a clue, the computer prints the first letter of the word
    - if the user still inputs the wrong answer, the computer makes fun of them
  -   if the user does not accept a clue, they can continue to write in an answer
